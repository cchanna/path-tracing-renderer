#Graphics
This is the beginning of a project to take the code I wrote for my Graphics and
Advanced Graphics college courses and make it look more presentable, run on
windows, and output completed renders as gifs using ginsweater's
[gif-h](https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h.git).

Right now, I'm working on building the windows platform layer.
