#Path-Tracing Renderer
This is the beginning of a project to take the code I wrote for my Graphics and
Advanced Graphics college courses and re-write it to look more presentable, run on
windows, and output completed renders as gifs using ginsweater's
[gif-h](https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h.git).

I recently completed adding rudimentary shading and a simple dithering process.
I will continue to rebuild the rest of the functionality element by element.
