#Path-Tracing Renderer
A project to take the code I wrote for my Advanced Graphics college course
and re-write it to look more presentable, run on windows, and output completed
renders as gifs.

![Basic shading](http://cchanna.github.io/path-tracing-renderer/test.gif)

I have been rebuilding the original functionality element by element, so I can
feel more comfortable with the process and hopefully create a more efficient and
readable implementation. The flickering and image quality issues are a result
of using ginsweater's gif-h -- I will replace it with something more consistent
as a project at some point.
