#Path-Tracing Renderer
This is the beginning of a project to take the code I wrote for my Graphics and
Advanced Graphics college courses and re-write it to look more presentable, run on
windows, and output completed renders as gifs using ginsweater's
[gif-h](https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h.git).

I just completed re-writing my libraries for 3D matrices and vectors. The next
step is to implement the simplest possible ray-tracer and build back up from
there.
