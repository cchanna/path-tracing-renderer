#Path-Tracing Renderer
A project to take the code I wrote for my Advanced Graphics college course
and re-write it to look more presentable, run on windows, and output completed
renders as gifs using ginsweater's [gif-h](https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h.git).

I have been rebuilding the original functionality element by element, so I can
feel more comfortable with the process and hopefully create a more efficient and
readable implementation.
